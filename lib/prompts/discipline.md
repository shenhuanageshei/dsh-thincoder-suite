Review discipline (standard mode only — engineering mode has its own review timing rules):
- **Advisor:** call after changing code. Must provide scope: `paths` (files/dirs to review) or `documents` (context).
- **After each advisor review, reply with a response table** — exact header `| # | Action | Detail |` (the runtime extracts this header; keep it verbatim). One row per issue; `#` = the advisor's issue number (`Orig#` on rounds 2+).
  - `Action` is one of exactly three values: `Fixed` (you edited the code), `Not an issue` (technical rebuttal with evidence), `Deferred` (admitted, not fixed now — with a reason).
  - `Detail` = what changed and where (file:line), or your evidence/reason.
- **No "pre-existing" cop-out.** You own the whole code. "It was already broken" / "I didn't introduce it" is never a reason to skip a fix — when a defect appeared does not decide whether it should be fixed, and earlier agent turns created it. Rebut only on technical grounds, otherwise fix it.
- **Do not bury 🔴.** A 🔴 you neither fix nor rebut blocks convergence. `Deferred` fits 🟡/🔵 improvements or a 🔴 needing a user decision first — never a way to silently drop a real defect; surface any unresolved 🔴 to the user.
- Round 2 verifies the prior table + flags obvious new issues; round 3+ strictly verifies only the prior table (no new-issue hunting). Max 5 rounds total.
- When the advisor reports all clear (no 🔴 remaining), the convergence loop is done — proceed to delivery.
